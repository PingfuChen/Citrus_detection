# Citrus_detection
A kind of citrus detection method

#Install

git clone https://github.com/PingfuChen/Citrus_detection.git

cd Method

pip install -r requirements.txt

#Main work

This project mainly designs a Lightweight green citrus fruit detection method for practical environmental applicationsï¼Œwhich solves the problem of image blurring and degradation in the process of data acquisition in practical environmental applications and the real-time problem of citrus green fruit detection.

#Inference with detect.py

detect.py runs inference on a variety of sources, downloading models automatically from the latest YOLOv5 release and saving results to .runs/detect
python detect.py --sorce '' --data '' --weights ''

#Training

Use the following command to train,and you can train on your own dataset.
python train.py --data CitursVocdata.yaml --cfg our.yaml --weights '' --batch-size 16

#DataSet

Due to file transfer limitations, please contact the author for the datasets and models used in this project if necessary
